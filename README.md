Hello, I have created this application using a simple React application template , you can clone the repository and then run ‘npm start’ in the root folder , that should start the application on localhost:3000

These are some changes I would have made if I had more time :-
1. I would have divided the application into multiple components , the structure which i would have followed would be one card component which would have taken the First Name, Last Name , the Email and the department of the user and passed it on as props to the card component , I would have then iteratively rendered the card component for all the users which we got , also the form which shows up when we click on the edit button of any of the user can be shifted to another component and probably reused for the add new user button as well 
2. The CSS used is very basic and bulky , I could have used something something like bootstrap to make the css much less bulky 
3. If I had more time I would integrate loaders when the API calls are being made to make the application more interactive
